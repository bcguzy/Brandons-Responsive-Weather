## A weather website built as my first foray into APIs and web design.

[Openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/api) is used as a weather provider via their current weather API for current weather and zip code coordinates and their onecall API for future weather forecasts.  
[Bootstrap css](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [Owfont](https://websygen.github.io/owfont/) were used in the design of the website.
